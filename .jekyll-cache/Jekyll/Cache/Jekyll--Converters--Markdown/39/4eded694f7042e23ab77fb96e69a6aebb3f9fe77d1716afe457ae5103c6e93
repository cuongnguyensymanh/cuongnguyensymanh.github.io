I".<p>Sales Management System is a web application. Members of the system will use to management bill and inventory and warehouse, etc. Reporting by day and month and quarter and year. This is only a mock project from FPT, I worked on it as a staff of the company. I got certifications GST from FPT after I complete the project. I am 1 of 17 of more 40 students joined course who got certifications. My team had 4 members but 1 person gave up. So, we continue to try to complete it. It didnâ€™t perfectly complete but at least we have completed it already.</p>
