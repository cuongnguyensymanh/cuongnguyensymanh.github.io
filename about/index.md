### Software Engineer

I have been using DotNet Advanced, Golang, NodeJS, Python and the Agile methodology for the last eight years.
I can speak English and Vietnamese well enough to get my point across.
Because I have prior experience working both onsite and remotely with clients from all over the world, I am able to work independently.
